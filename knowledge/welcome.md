# Welcome to my Mental Palace

Welcome ! I store here the most valuable knowledge I've acquired and I'm glad you're interested in it. While I aim to present this information very pedagogically, my primary goal is in fact selfish: to remember and organize my learnings from life's grand school... think of this palace more as notes.

My pursuit of knowledge focuses on five core disciplines:

- `Mathematics`: Enhancing logic
- `Physics`: Understanding nature's workings
- `Economics` & `Finance`: Grasping societal connections in our DAMN capitalist world
- `Computer Science`: Mastering humanity's current main tool
- `Machine Learning`: Preparing for tomorrow's revolution

This is a lifelong project, built on my degrees in physics and mathematics. My goal? To reach the equivalent of:

- a PhD in machine learning
- a master‚Äôs in physics and finance
- a bachelor‚Äôs in economics and computer science

Yeah‚Ä¶ I'll not achieve this üò≠.

But the beauty is in the journey: consistency, patience and seeing the connections between fields. Stay strong, don't cry, breathe deep üòÆ‚Äçüí®, and keep going.

I also like `sociology`, `philosophy`, and `psychology`. So maybe you will see some notes about these fields.
