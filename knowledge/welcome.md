# Welcome to my Mental Palace

Welcome ! I store here the most valuable knowledge I've acquired and I'm glad you're interested in it. While I aim to present this information very pedagogically, my primary goal is in fact selfish: to remember and organize my learnings from life's grand school... think of this palace more as course notes.

My pursuit of knowledge focuses on five core disciplines:

- `Mathematics`: Enhancing logic
- `Physics`: Understanding nature's workings
- `Economics` & `Finance`: Grasping societal connections in our DAMN capitalist world
- `Computer Science`: Mastering humanity's current main tool
- `Machine Learning`: Preparing for tomorrow's revolution

This **lifelong project** builds on my existing licence degrees in physics and mathematics, aiming to get the same level as a PhD in machine learning, a master's in physics and finance, and a bachelor's in economics and computer science.

The secret to mastering all these fields? Consistence and recognizing their interconnectedness. Each discipline complements the others, creating an "easy" holistic understanding of our world. Stay strong and relax 😮‍💨 !

However, knowledge alone isn't enough. To truly excel, one must understand humanity through `sociology`, `philosophy`, and `psychology`. These fields help us connect with and influence others, making expertise as effective as it is useless...

(And also don't forget to shower and exercise during this trip 😭)
