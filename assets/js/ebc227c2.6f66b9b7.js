Unlike a traditional AI algorithm, which can relies on hard-coded rules (such as many if and else conditions), ML learns from data to provide more appropriate responses. Historically, this learning was closely related to statistics. However, with the rise of \\"black box\\" algorithms, which may deliver better performance, a distinction has emerged between two subfields of ML: Statistical Learning (SL) and Deep Learning (DL).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"machine-learning/statistical-learning/introduction":{"id":"machine-learning/statistical-learning/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"machine-learning/statistical-modeling/appendix":{"id":"machine-learning/statistical-modeling/appendix","title":"Appendix","description":"This appendix is intended to go into more detail on certain subjects that have been skimmed over in this chapter, because of their minor impact on the overall understanding of the subject.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"machine-learning/statistical-modeling/estimators":{"id":"machine-learning/statistical-modeling/estimators","title":"Estimators","description":"Fisher Information","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"machine-learning/statistical-modeling/introduction":{"id":"machine-learning/statistical-modeling/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Statistical learning is based on \\"well-formed\\"statistical models.
